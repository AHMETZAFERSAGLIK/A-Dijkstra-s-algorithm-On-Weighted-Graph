# One algorithm for finding the shortest path 
from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph
is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The algorithm creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the
source, to all other points in the graph..
In the algorithm all we are looking from nodes perspective.We calculate for each node which
neighbor nodes are closer.Then we are finding our path from src to dest by using this infos.
